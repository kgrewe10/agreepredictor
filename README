---Agree Predictor v1---


-Built on 64 Bit Linux
-Platform independent if JVM is installed.

READ BEFORE RUNNING APPLICATION:

1. To run the cache simulator you must have a JVM installed on the system.  Once the JVM is installed, you may proceed.

2. The executable JAR file agreepredictor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar is located in /target directory along with the traces.

3. java -jar [jarfile] [arg1] [arg2]... etc. is the format to run the jar.

4. To enter the help menu: java -jar agreepredictor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar help

5. This application is applicable to Pin traces as well as the GCC trace.

6. This application takes in 4 arguments in order as specified below.  Order matters.



ARGUMENTS FORMAT

[table_size] [counter_bits] [inputfilename] [outputfilename]

table_size: The total number of entries in the PHT.
     values: any multiple of two
counter_bits: The number of bits to use for the PHT counter.
     values: any divisible by 2.
associativity: The associativity of the cache.  Use 1 for direct mapped.
     values: any multiple of two
inputfilename: The name of the input file to use for the simulation.
     values: a string
outputfilename: The name of the output file to create with results.
     values: a string
